            and an Introduction to Procedural Generation</h2>
            <p><em>From Some Instructions:</em></p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>George Brecht was a man of many trades in the
            mid-twentieth century: a World War II soldier, chemist,
            tampon designer, and Fluxus artist. Brecht is credited with
            creating the ‘event score’, a written form of performance
            art. His inspiration was drawn from his friend, the
            self-proclaimed un-artist Allan Kaprow, whose pieces icame
            in the form of live performance piecs or ‘happenings.’
            Kaprow would give performers his elaborate instructions to
            enact within his gallery space.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>While intrigued by Kaprow’s ‘happenings.’ Brecht became
            bored by didactic, overly specific instructions. Brecht’s
            approach to the event score was less detailed, more oblique,
            and open to intrepretation. For example:</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Three Chair Event</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Sitting on a black chair. Occurrence.</li>
            <li>Yellow chair. (Occurence.)</li>
            <li>On (or near) a white chair. Occurence,</li>
            </ul>
            <p>–Spring 1961</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>A wide variety of artists acquainted with the Fluxus
            movement wrote event scores, among them Yoko Ono and La
            Monte Young. At times the scores were performed live at
            festivals; other times they were read as texts. Keeping
            accessibilyt in mind, these scores were cheaply printed on
            notecards and distributed through the mail. This served to
            skip the ‘gallery space’ step altogether, countering the
            notion of the physical art object.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>….Each contribution is open to your creative
            interpretation. You’re urged to perform these instructions
            private, publicly, or ‘negative’ (i.e. not at all). You can
            decide to simply read the instrucitons - alone, in front of
            your cat, or before a stadium full of spectators. You can
            float these instructions on the surface of a nearby lake.
            You can post your favorite peroframnec on YouTube and tag
            it’ skywalkers’ gangnam style star wars lego.’ The choice is
            yours. You’re the artist.</p>

            <p>The text in the following section was translated via
            Google Translate, January 2025.</p>
            <p>Chullachaqui 5: the ‘color’ of thelema</p>
            <p>No information processing can take place without a
            program and a computer. For “Pappagallo 2,” Mariotti
            developed “Chullachaqui 5.” Chullachanqui is a word in
            Quechua that defines beings that seem alive but are invented
            by witches and therefore can be considered as small demons,
            however, the Chullachaqui seeks to befriend human beings.
            Mariotti’s work linked to the Chullachaquis dates back to
            1981 in the series of engravings from the book “The Three
            Halves of Ino-Moxo and Other Witches of the Amazon” by the
            Peruvian poet Cesar Calvo, where Mariotti combines Ashaninka
            graphics with electronic circuits (Bendayán 2006).</p>
            <p>“Chullachaqui 5” was developed by Manolo Rodríguez and
            programmed in BASIC 2.0 on a Commodore C64, which was the
            same machine used during its presentation in installation
            format. The “Pappagallo 2” setup included, in addition to
            the computer, a 5 ¼ floppy disk drive for reading the
            program (the classic Commodore model 1541) and a
            “dot-matrix” printer (model MPS 803) that allowed the public
            to take home a printed sheet with the processed texts.</p>
            <p>The Commodore C64, produced at the end of 1982, was one
            of the first low-cost personal computers, and unlike other
            competing machines of the time, such as the Apple II, IBM PC
            or Atari 800, it was launched at an aggressive price and
            with distribution in department stores to encourage its
            domestic use, even beating European competitors such as the
            English Sinclair. The Commodore used the MOS
            Technology-developed 6510 8-bit processor, with 64 kilobytes
            of RAM and a sound processor that provided some
            sophisticated advantages in sound processing for that time
            despite having only 3 programmable filter channels (MOS
            Technology 6581/8580 SID). An additional advantage of using
            the Commodore C64 was its composite video output which, as
            in the case of video game consoles of the time, allowed the
            use of conventional TV monitors. The Commodore C64 was one
            of the longest-lived machine models in history, being
            produced for over 12 years.</p>
            <p>“Chullachaqui 5” allowed the generation of random stanzas
            from any text. There was a certain level of sophistication
            in relation to this randomness, for example, it not only
            meant that the order varied, but also that the number of
            stanzas in the poems played by the machine was modified. The
            result is interesting, explains Mariotti: “On the one hand,
            randomness allows us to see how the order of a poem is often
            an attempt by many to prefix a meaning, but there are many
            other meanings.” Perhaps one of the most emblematic works in
            the field of random poetry is Raymond Queneau’s “Cent mille
            milliards de poemes” (Queneau 1961), a book composed of
            stanzas divided by breaks in the pages that allow readers to
            combine stanzas from different pages to generate new
            compositions and meanings.</p>
            <p>Tribute to syntactic thinking</p>
            <p>The effects of randomness, especially some of its most
            surprising results, increased enthusiasm for artificial
            intelligence. “Papagayo 2” coincided with one of the final
            stages of the first great boom in artificial intelligence,
            which had begun in the seventies with semantic networks and
            continued in the eighties with meanings generated from
            perception (Steels 2006). Artificial intelligence was not
            only perceived as a solution to the problems of
            post-industrial automation, but also, from a philosophical
            perspective, it was linked to improving the quality of human
            life.</p>
            <p>However, since computers are syntactic machines
            (Kallinikos 2002), they are only sensitive to the form of
            specification given by the data entered, but not to the
            meaning (Dreyfus 1992; Dreyfus 2001). This syntactical
            thought can also lead to new meanings, to ways of thinking
            that we would never have imagined. The random sense produced
            by works of art often tells us things that we do not
            imagine. Beyond the automation of the machine and its
            logical-deterministic purpose, the randomness that is
            produced can also give rise to singular results. Many
            artists have worked with some kind of randomness to generate
            new forms of visualization that have resulted from complex
            genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming (Sims 1991;
            Maeda 1999; Maeda and Burns 2004).</p>
            <p>There is a fundamental aspect attached to the principle
            of randomness, which is the mixing of different contents to
            create hybrid results. Although this is a field that may
            have reminiscences in collage, today it is used more
            frequently due to the excess of available information (Lyman
            and Varian 2003) and its level of interoperability. What is
            commonly known today as mashups, a term that initially comes
            from the ‘mix’ that DJs make of different musical extracts
            to generate new rhythms, can be seen as the result of media
            content associated with functionalities that are not
            predefined and therefore function as symbolic processors
            (Dietrich 2000). Much of the failure of artificial
            intelligence has today led to the generation of collective
            or social intelligences that come from new forms of
            information interoperability (O’Reilly 2005).</p>
            <p>Is there then an intelligence in random thinking? Many of
            the combinations that are generated are surprising, but many
            others are disappointing and lack meaning. A chaotic poetic
            work like Toti’s obeys an order and a search for meaning in
            nonsense. Therefore, when listening to or reading the
            statements generated by “Pappagallo 2” one is not entirely
            surprised, and the computer seems to become a natural
            component of the full exercise of Toti’s poetry. Mariotti’s
            “Pappagallo 2” and the regenerated Totian poems show that,
            beyond a semantic search, poetry is still the space where
            decontextualizations can produce an order that only human
            beings can understand and feel.</p>

            by Amy Goodchild (25 - 30 minute read, overview)</p>
            <p>Read <em>Chapter 3 - Cybernature</em> of Mitchel
            Whitelaw’s Metacreation on Artificial Life - <a
            href="https://ia800604.us.archive.org/19/items/MicheleWhiteTheBodyAndTheScreen/Metacreation_Art_and_Artificial_Life.pdf">link
            to PDF</a>. In the PDF this this starts on the 75th page and
            continues to the 114th page, on the early and recent history
            of algorithmic art and ecosystems. Page 75 has a picture of
            “Interactive Plant Growing” and the section ends after a
            description of Natalie Jeremijenko’s A-life art. About 35 -
            40 minutes reading.</p>

            (final)</h2>
            <p>Creating a single, cohesive ecosystem of various
            entitites interacting in a digitel simulation. These should
            consist of various objects, respond to forces, and produce
            novel output each time it is run, throughout its run.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>A-life begins with a notion of life that is wholly
            materialistic, involving no soul, vital force, or essence.
            In the words of the convenor of the first artificial life
            workshop, Christopher Langton, ‘Living organisms are nothing
            more that complex biochemical machines.’ Langton contends
            that rather than being any special substance or force, life
            is ‘a property of the organization of matter.’ Further, this
            organization is not simply a complex structure but a dynamic
            structure, a system active in real time: for a-life, life is
            most importantly manifest in behavior.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
            <li>Your project should consist of class and objects, and
            the environment should have forces. This could be gravity,
            wind. Create attraction forces, and create images or
            animations that fit your ecosystem concept.</li>
