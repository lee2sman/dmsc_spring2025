            <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
            <p>An intermediate lecture/studio course that explores
            techniques for creating dynamic, poetic, and lifelike
            animations in code. Students learn techniques to program
            movement and the simulation of natural systems and
            behaviors, and develop works that respond to various inputs.
            Projects are developed using open-source software
            environments like Processing and p5.js.</p>
            <h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>
            <p>Students will:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Gain skills and experience using open source creative
            coding environments as a medium for art</li>
            <li>Develop poetic and critical experimental works in
            software</li>
            <li>Critically engage with historic and contemporary
            computational art practices, including various generative
            art techniques</li>
            <li>Refine their personal learning strategies, project
            planning and problem solving skills</li>

            Philosophy and Classroom Community</h3>
            <p>It is my goal that we collaborate together to create a
            community of learners. I will try to serve as coach rather
            than boss and help you pursue your own learning goals and I
            am excited to learn from you as well. I will vary my
            teaching methods to make sure that the course is accessible
            to all students. I believe everyone has the ability to do
            well in this course. I will be accessible to you during
            class sessions, by email, and by message board. I want you
            to succeed both in our class and at Purchase. I will always
            try to help you.</p>
            <p>I am not the sole source of knowledge for this course. As
            digital natives and as people with your own background and
            interests you are all experts as well. Most importantly to
            me, please pursue those subjects that interest you deeply
            and share them with your classmates and me.</p>

            students</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Practice good listening skills by eliminating
            distractions. Please put your phone somewhere else. Try
            wearing headphones. And do your best to make your space free
            from distraction.</li>
            <li>Let us make space for others in discussions. Those of us
            who talk a lot will especially try this out. Those of us who
            are shy will try to participate in ways that feel
            comfortable including through writing, text chats, meeting
            one on one with the professor, or working in smaller groups
            or pairs with other classmates, and also try to take
            risks.</li>
            <li>Do the assignments, including reading. I will not assign
            what I think is <em>busy</em> work. Please give me feedback
            on the assignments.</li>
            <li>Show up on time. Do not miss class. We meet weekly.
            Missing a class is missing a lot of information.</li>
            <li>Do all assigned reading/watching and homework prior to
            class.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Listen actively and enthusiastically to students and
            help facilitate their learning.</li>
            <li>Be on time and accessible to students in and out of the
            classroom.</li>
            <li>Listen to student feedback and make changes when
            possible.</li>
            <li>Respond quickly to student needs. Respond to all email
            during the week within 24 hours. It may take me more time to
            respond on weekends.</li>
            <li>Grade objectively and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Accomodate differences in student learning.</li>

            <p>The Purchase College academic integrity policy, <a

            explicitly forbids cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of
            academic dishonesty. Plagiarism is the appropriation or
            imitation of the language, ideas, and/or thoughts of another
            person and the representation of them as one’s own original
            work. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves
            with the definition of plagiarism and the acceptable methods
            of attribution.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Violation of any of the above may lead to formal
            disciplinary action and the following sanctions: - Minimum
            Sanction: Failing grade on the assignment or examination.
            Maximum Sanction: Expulsion - Recommended Sanction (First
            Offense): Failing grade for the course - Recommended
            Sanction (Second Offense): Expulsion</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Students who have any questions or doubts about whether
            any activity is academically permissible should check with
            the instructor.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Plagiarism and cheating are taken seriously. You will be
            held accountable for Purchase’s <a
            href="https://www.purchase.edu/offices/community-standards/student-code-of-conduct/section-a-academic-integrity/index.php">Student
            Code of Conduct for Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="class-policy-on-collaboration">Class policy on
            Collaboration</h3>
            <p>I support collaborative learning with some important
            caveats.</p>
            <p>Coding can be difficult, and struggling with the material
            is part of the learning process. Students are allowed to
            collaborate to learn from each other. Do not collaborate in
            order to simply find out a solution to a project. Each
            participant should contribute approximately equally, and
            what you turn in should be your own. Copying a solution from
            another student, even if you change a few minor things such
            as variable names, is not a collaboration. You may help
            someone learn something, but you can not tell them what to
            code. If you have questions about collaboration or academic
            integrity, get in touch with me via email, talk with me
            before or after class, or come to office hours.</p>
            <h2
            id="chatgpt-and-large-language-models-llm-policy">ChatGPT
            and Large Language Models (LLM) Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The use of ChatGPT and other similar Large
            Language Models are prohibited for writing and coding
            assignments, unless otherwise cleared with the
            professor.</strong> The point of this class is to learn the
            material by wrestling with it. I believe these systems
            prevent the learner from actually learning the material and
            being able to put it to use. Additionally, information is
            often wrong, poorly written, unattributed, contains biases,
            and the process of running machine learning is quite bad for
            the environment.</p>
            <p>I do make exceptions for this hard rule: you are
            permitted the use of these for exploratory investigation if
            you so choose. “What are examples of artists working with
            artificial life?”, “What are some of the techniques game
            developers use to create procedurally generated 2d top down
            levels?” These are exploratory questions that can help lead
            you to find new sources. But your own turned in writing,
            artwork and code should be by you. Should you have questions
            on this policy, come and speak to me.</p>
            <p>Violations of this policy will be treated the same as
            academic dishonesty and plagiarism.</p>
            <h3 id="tutoring-support">Tutoring Support</h3>
            <p>All students at Purchase College can take advantage of
            our tutoring services in the Learning Center (Lib 0009) and
            the Einstein Corner (NSS 3044). These are free, 45-minute,
            peer-to-peer tutoring sessions in a variety of subjects and
            in writing across the disciplines. I encourage you to take
            advantage of this service to help you excel in this class,
            as well as your other courses. Please visit the <a
            href="https://www.purchase.edu/offices/learning-center/index.php">Learning
            Center</a> and <a

            Corner</a> websites for more information.</p>
            <h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
            <p>Learning programming is a cumulative effort. Each class
            builds on what you have learned in previous classes. Missing
            class can substantially set you back in this process.
            <strong>Therefore, it is important that you attend every
            class.</strong> Absences should be excused by a doctor’s
            note. Three unexcused absences will lower your grade by one
            unit. (i.e. an A will became a B). With each additional
            unexcused absences, the grade will drop an additional unit
            for each absence. If there is an emergency or otherwise
            extenuating circumstance that prevents you from attending
            class, please email me.</p>
            <p>We will be covering critical concepts and working on code
            and projects in-class and you are responsible for reviewing
            our class site and reaching out to your peers outside of
            class time to catch up on what you have missed.</p>
            <h2 id="evaluations-of-the-professor">Evaluations of the
            Professor</h2>
            <p>There will be 3 designated times to provide feedback to
            the professor during the semester: during the first week of
            class, mid-semester, and as feedback at the end of the
            semester. You can also approach me in class or during office
            hours at any other time in the semester to give feedback.
            Please hold me accountable and point out areas that need to
            be improved.</p>
            <h2 id="requesting-help">Requesting Help</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>When you get stuck on a problem with your code take a
            break such as by taking a walk before coming back to try
            again. Another strategy is to try to explain your code’s
            logic to a friend or family member, even someone who doesn’t
            code.</li>
            <li>In this class I encourage you to work with other
            students to help each other. Learning together and teaching
            each other is the best way to learn new information.</li>
            <li>When you are sending me code, please send a <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">minimal
            version</a>, what you expected to see, and what you are
            getting. It can take me up to 24 hours to respond to emails,
            and longer on weekends or at the end of semesters.</li>

            <li>Do Pair Programming.</li>
            <li>Start your homework early, do it in a quiet place, and
            minimize distractions. For a 4 credit class, students are
            expected to spend 8 hours of work outside class per week

            <li>Stay on top of your work. It will be hard to recover if
            you fall behind. This is a self-directed course but there
            are very real deadlines. The key will be slow and steady

            ‘traditionally.’ I will do 1-on-1 check-ins with you
