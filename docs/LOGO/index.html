            <p>This class will be taught like a lab.</p>
            <p>Each week we will do at least one experiment or workshop
            where we explore new ideas in art and code. I will introduce
            at least one new concept or technique, then students will
            work in small groups or solo in a “jam” style, spending time
            experimenting and building projects that expand on the
            concept.</p>
            <p><strong>STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO DOCUMENT THEIR WORK EACH
            WEEK OF THE SEMESTER THROUGH A DEVELOPMENT LOG
            (DEVLOG)</strong>. This is also one of the primary ways we
            will evaluate student work and progress throughout the
            semester.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Logo is an educational programming language, designed in
            1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert, and Cynthia Solomon.
            A general-purpose language, Logo is widely known for its use
            of turtle graphics, in which commands for movement and
            drawing produced line or vector graphics, either on screen
            or with a small robot termed a turtle. The language was
            conceived to teach concepts of programming related to Lisp
            and only later to enable what Papert called “body-syntonic
            reasoning”, where students could understand, predict, and
            reason about the turtle’s motion by imagining what they
            would do if they were the turtle. There are substantial
            differences among the many dialects of Logo, and the
            situation is confused by the regular appearance of turtle
            graphics programs that are named Logo.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>The first working Logo turtle robot was created in 1969.
            A display turtle preceded the physical floor turtle. Modern
            Logo has not changed very much from the basic concepts
            predating the first turtle. The first turtle was a tethered
            floor roamer, not radio-controlled or wireless. At BBN Paul
            Wexelblat developed a turtle named Irving that had touch
            sensors and could move forwards, backwards, rotate, and ding
            its bell.</p>

            <em>LOGO Robot “with eyes” at MIT, 1974, via <a
            href="http://harveycohen.net/oznaki/">Harvey
            Cohen</a></em></p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Logo’s most-known feature is the turtle (derived
            originally from a robot of the same name),[5] an on-screen
            “cursor” that showed output from commands for movement and
            small retractable pen, together producing line graphics. It
            has traditionally been displayed either as a triangle or a
            turtle icon (though it can be represented by any icon).
            Turtle graphics were added to the Logo language by Seymour
            Papert in the late 1960s to support Papert’s version of the
            turtle robot, a simple robot controlled from the user’s
            workstation that is designed to carry out the drawing
            functions assigned to it using a small retractable pen set
            into or attached to the robot’s body.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>As a practical matter, the use of turtle geometry instead
            of a more traditional model mimics the actual movement logic
            of the turtle robot. The turtle moves with commands that are
            relative to its own position, LEFT 90 means spin left by 90
            degrees. Some Logo implementations, particularly those that
            allow the use of concurrency and multiple turtles, support
            collision detection and allow the user to redefine the
            appearance of the turtle cursor, essentially allowing the
            Logo turtles to function as sprites.</p>

            Crazy Quilt</h2>
            <p>For this project your job is to define digital ‘quilt
            blocks’ that can be drawn in LOGO, then have your Turtle
            create a random block crazy quilt constructed out of these
            pieces.</p>
            <p>Steps: * Create a standard quilt ‘block’ recipe. The
            turtle should start at the top left, draw a block, then
            finish at the top right corner (so that it can begin drawing
            the next). * Then make more quilt blocks of many variations.
            * Write a program that starts the turtle at the top left,
            picks a random block to draw, then another, then
            another…Every 6 blocks the turtle should move to the left
            side of the quilt and one row down. The turtle should draw 8
            rows of 6 blocks.</p>
            <p>Note: You are allowed (and encouraged) to work
            collaboratively on this project.</p>
            <p>Method:</p>
            <p>Assume a standard square block size of 40 by 40 pixels.
            Note: we may alter this size in class if we deem it too
            small.</p>
            <p>Create a function to move your turtle to the top
            left.</p>
            <p>Create a function to draw a quilt block.</p>
            <p>Create more quilt blocks as functions.</p>
            <p>Create a function that is a random chooser that will pick
            a quilt block function at random to draw.</p>
            <p>Create a row function that draws 6 random blocks then
            moves to the left side and down one block.</p>
            <p>Put it all together.</p>

            on in order, including images potentially.</p>
            <p>Next, describe particular areas of investigation, things
            you figured out, things you got stuck on. You can also
            describe areas that appear promising or most compelling, and
            what questions you still might have or areas to explore
