LLM transformer models

pure randomness -> Markov chains -> ML language models

## Final Project guidelines

Your final project is a project that makes use of procedural generation. It can be a procedurally-generated game, story, art toy or other digital media.

It is permitted to include 'hand-crafted' content as well as procedurally-generated content.

The final project should be a compelling work that is complete on its own and produces different meaningful results each time it is run.

Write a proposal for your final project. Includes screenshots of other media that has influenced your thinking, and any thoughts, techniques for building, or questions that you have at this time.

High level idea: You are worldbuilding, creating an ecosystem of characters, a world with varied terrain or environment, and procedurally generated objects in that world and text.

Deliverables:
* a character that a player can play
* procedurally generate a terrain or environment
* procedurally generate characters in the world
* procedurally generate text that meaningfully flavors the world, its characters or environment

Optional:
* procedurally generated music
* playable with win/lose states
