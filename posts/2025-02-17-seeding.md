## Computers are not good at being random...

## Being random is expensive, and usually not that important... (casinos etc) 

But you can sort of simulate randomness by using complex math. Randomness is really just a word we use when two things are unrelated or unpredictable in context. The pattern that *prngs* (pseudo-random number generators) produce is too complicated to be recognized, so it feels random. The same could be said about true random, but on a much larger scale, i.e. no human or computer can predict the pattern.

## Seeding Randomness

A **seed** is the starting point of this psuedo random function, which continues to get complicated, and ends up in a different (same) place depending on the start. You’re setting the start of a path.

(nothing is random - just uncoupled from each other)



## Workshop: Oblique Strategies

Making something like the oblique strategies (orig credit to “amcc”), based on the [original deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) of cards by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt.

...but constraining it to be one per day.

## HW

Based on Jonah's presentation on his projects and seeding randomness, create a p5.js-based work with updated "daily" (or other period) of updating generative content.

Consider producing images, artwork, creative prompts, a recipe, or something else.

The work should have a clear concept and produce output you find meaningful and compelling.

## Suggested video from Jonah

[The Science of Chaos](https://pbswisconsin.org/watch/university-place/university-place-the-science-of-chaos-ep-145/) - "what chaos is all about, and why some people are devoting their careers to it."
